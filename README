Simple TWAIN scanner application
================================

A tiny windows application which retrieves images from your scanner.

Builds with MinGW-w64 and the WDK7. Runs on WinXP or newer.

Code and ideas that you can steal:

* How to use the TWAIN API, including a thin wrapper library over
  the raw TWAIN entry point (twainhelper.{h,cpp})
* How to show a folder browser dialog (folderbrowsehelper.{h,cpp})
* How to save bitmaps using GDI+
* How to use commctl v6 with visual styles, while loading 3rd party
  code (i.e. the scanner driver) with commctl v5
* How to use high DPI in your own code only, with 3rd party code using
  DPI scaling provided by Windows
* How to build a desktop app with the WDK
